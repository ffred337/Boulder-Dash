# Boulder-Dash
Hi.
This project was about the design of an abandonware named "BoulderDash".

For the realization of this game, our group was named "GROUP 8" and was composed of the following members:
-FRED TCHIADEU (Project Manager and Main Developer)
-LULA MBECK (Assistant Developer) 
-SHERYL KEMMEGNE (Database Administrator and Level Designer)
-DAMIEN NEMATCHOUA ( Tester and Assistant Developer)
All these members are from the IUI-X2026 class

In spite of the various difficulties met throughout this project, we did our best to carry out it and thus to produce 
this version which you consult currently.


We are open to advice and closed to any non-constructive (or non-productive) criticism.
